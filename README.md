# Sprint Zero
## goal setting
make a paper tower a least 50cm in a week
## research
## ideation
I haven't done any sketching for this tower, I watched some videos about it and just started to build
## prototyping

prototype one: similar structure from the video, with a three-piece leg as the base, and a separate piece of paper functions as a connector between the base and upper structure.  
Problems: the base is not strong enough and therefore the upper piece started to tilt after two pieces of paper. The connection also can't hold the base and the top part.

Learned from Eric, I made some changes to his design and increased the size of each piece, and cut an opening from each piece so they connect better. However, this structure will need a stronger base and I haven't currently made a proper base for it.
## testing 
## final design
don't have time for a final design, should look like the second version with a bigger base

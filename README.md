prototype one: similar structure from the video, with a three piece leg as base, a separated piece of paper functions as a connector between base and upper structure.  
Problems: the base is not strong enough and therefore the upper piece started to tilt after two piece of paper. The connect also can't hold the base steady and the top part.

Learned from Eric, I made some changes to his design and increased the size of each piece and cut an opening from each piece so they connect better. However, this structure will need a stronger base and I haven't currently made a proper base for it.
